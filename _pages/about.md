Welcome 
======
I'm a research statistician currently studying at the University of Western Australia. My thesis is entitled "Bayesian regularisation from stochastic constraints". I like to research applied, computational, and theoretical problems in statistics. 

My main areas of interest are regularisation, constrained non-linear regression, election polling, survey methods, log-linear models, and semi-infinite programming.

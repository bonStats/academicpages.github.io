I'm a research statistician currently studying at the University of Western Australia. My thesis is entitled "Bayesian regularisation from stochastic constraints". I like to research applied, computational, and theoretical problems in statistics. 

My main areas of interest are:
- Bayesian methods and computation
- multilevel / hierarchical models
- regularisation
- constrained non-linear regression
- election polling
- survey methods
- log-linear models
- semi-infinite programming
